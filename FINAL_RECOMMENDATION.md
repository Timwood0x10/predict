## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Choose Your Action

```bash
# Option A: Real-time analysis
bash run_trading_analysis.sh

# Option B: Backtest strategy  
bash run_backtest.sh

# Option C: Diagnose issues
python check_safety.py --symbol BTCUSDT
```

### Step 2: Understand the Output

**Key sections to watch:**

1. **AI Decision Layer** - AI's independent analysis
   - Shows suggestion even if final is HOLD
   - Displays suggested position for reference

2. **Decision Engine** - Safety validation
   - Shows if safety checks passed
   - Explains failure reasons

3. **Final Decision** - Combined result
   - Explains why AI suggestion wasn't followed (if applicable)
   - Provides actionable advice

### Step 3: Take Action Based on Output

**If final decision is LONG/SHORT:**
✅ All systems go! Follow the position management plan

**If final decision is HOLD but AI suggests trade:**
- Review AI's suggested position (shown in output)
- Check why it wasn't executed
- Monitor conditions - may improve later
- Optional: Follow AI at your own risk (reduce leverage!)

**If safety check failed:**
```bash
# Run diagnostics to see which check failed
python check_safety.py --symbol BTCUSDT

# Take appropriate action based on failure
```

## 📊 The 3 Scripts You Need

### 1. `run_trading_analysis.sh` - Daily Analysis

**Purpose:** Analyze current market and get trading signals

**Key Settings:**
```bash
CAPITAL=1000              # Your capital
LEVERAGE=10               # Leverage (1-125)
RISK=2.0                  # Risk per trade (%)
STOP_LOSS=2.0            # Stop loss (%)
SYMBOLS="BTCUSDT ETHUSDT" # Coins to analyze
SAVE_DATA="yes"          # Save data files
```

**Usage:**
```bash
vim run_trading_analysis.sh  # Edit settings
bash run_trading_analysis.sh # Run
```

**Output:**
- Console: Detailed report with AI suggestions
- Files: `data/analysis/*` (8 data dimension files)

---

### 2. `run_backtest.sh` - Strategy Testing

**Purpose:** Test strategy on historical data

**Key Settings:**
```bash
CAPITAL=1000              # Initial capital
LEVERAGE=10               # Leverage
SYMBOLS="BTCUSDT ETHUSDT" # Coins to test
BACKTEST_DAYS=7          # Days (1-30)
BACKTEST_INTERVAL="1h"   # Timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
```

**Usage:**
```bash
vim run_backtest.sh      # Edit settings
bash run_backtest.sh     # Run
```

**Output:**
- `data/backtest/*_trades_*.csv` - Trade log
- `data/backtest/*_stats_*.txt` - Performance metrics

**Interpret Results:**
```
Good Strategy:
✅ Win rate > 50%
✅ Avg win > Avg loss (1.5x+)
✅ Max drawdown < 20%
✅ Sharpe ratio > 1
```

---

### 3. `check_safety.py` - Diagnostics

**Purpose:** Understand why safety checks fail

**Usage:**
```bash
python check_safety.py --symbol BTCUSDT
```

**Output:** Shows which of 5 checks failed and why

**5 Safety Checks:**
1. Gas fees (< 30 Gwei or < 15 sat/vB)
2. Data completeness (≥ 8 news, > 0 AI predictions)
3. Market state (Fear & Greed 25-75) ← **Most common failure**
4. Volatility (< 4%)
5. Account status (< 3 positions, > 100 balance)

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Safety Check System

**Why it exists:**
Protects you from trading in dangerous conditions

**What it does:**
- Checks gas fees (avoid high costs)
- Verifies data quality (avoid bad decisions)
- Monitors market state (avoid extreme emotions)
- Measures volatility (avoid excessive risk)
- Checks account health (avoid overtrading)

**When it fails:**
System shows HOLD even if AI suggests trade

**What you see:**
```
💡 Note: AI suggests LONG, but not executed because:
   - Safety check failed: Fear & Greed index 24, below threshold 25
💡 Advice: Monitor market, consider AI's suggestion if conditions improve
```

### AI Suggestion Feature ✨ NEW!

**What changed:**
Previously, when safety failed, you saw:
```
【Final Decision】
  ⚪ Action: HOLD
  Confidence: 0%
```

Now, you also see:
```
【AI Decision Layer】
  🤖 AI Suggests: LONG
  📊 AI Confidence: 85%
  
  【AI Suggested Position】(Reference Only)
    Entry: $69,500.00
    Stop Loss: $68,110.00
    Position: 0.014368 coins
    Margin: 100.00 USDT
```

**Why this matters:**
- You know what AI thinks (transparency)
- You can consider AI's view (flexibility)
- You understand why it wasn't executed (education)
- You can prepare for when conditions improve (strategy)

**How to use it:**
1. ✅ **Do:** Use as reference, monitor conditions
2. ✅ **Do:** Wait for safety checks to pass
3. ⚠️ **Maybe:** Follow AI if you understand risks (reduce leverage!)
4. ❌ **Don't:** Blindly follow when safety failed

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Daily Trading Routine

```bash
# 1. Morning: Run analysis
bash run_trading_analysis.sh

# 2. If HOLD but AI suggests trade:
#    - Note AI's suggestion
#    - Check why not executed
#    - Monitor throughout day

# 3. If safety check failed:
python check_safety.py --symbol BTCUSDT
#    - See specific failure
#    - Take appropriate action

# 4. Re-run analysis when conditions may have improved
bash run_trading_analysis.sh
```

### Weekly Strategy Testing

```bash
# Test on multiple timeframes
# 1h for 7 days
BACKTEST_INTERVAL="1h" BACKTEST_DAYS=7 bash run_backtest.sh

# 4h for 14 days
BACKTEST_INTERVAL="4h" BACKTEST_DAYS=14 bash run_backtest.sh

# 1d for 30 days
BACKTEST_INTERVAL="1d" BACKTEST_DAYS=30 bash run_backtest.sh

# Compare results, optimize parameters
```

### Monthly Review

```bash
# Check saved data
ls -lh data/analysis/
ls -lh data/backtest/

# Analyze patterns
# - Which conditions led to wins/losses?
# - How often did AI suggestions differ from final?
# - What were common safety check failures?

# Adjust strategy accordingly
```

## ⚠️ Common Scenarios & Responses

### Scenario 1: Safety Check Failed (Fear & Greed < 25)

**Output:**
```
【Final Decision】
  ⚪ Action: HOLD
  Reason: ❌ Safety check failed

💡 Note: AI suggests LONG
   - Fear & Greed index 24, below threshold 25
```

**What it means:**
- Market is in panic mode
- High risk, oversold conditions
- Could be buying opportunity BUT risky

**What to do:**
1. ✅ Respect the safety check (system protecting you)
2. ✅ Note AI's suggestion for later
3. ✅ Run diagnostics daily: `python check_safety.py`
4. ✅ Wait for F&G to rise above 25
5. ⚠️ Optional: Enter at 1-3x leverage (not 10x) if you're experienced

**Timeline:** Usually 1-3 days for market to stabilize

### Scenario 2: Engine Score Insufficient

**Output:**
```
【Final Decision】
  ⚪ Action: HOLD
