## üîß Integration Implementation

### Data Collection Process

```python
def fetch_polymarket_data():
    """
    Fetch Polymarket prediction market data
    Returns: Dict with market probabilities and sentiment
    """
    # 1. Get relevant markets
    markets = get_crypto_markets()
    
    # 2. Extract probabilities
    probabilities = {}
    for market in markets:
        probabilities[market.question] = market.probability
    
    # 3. Calculate sentiment score
    sentiment = calculate_sentiment(probabilities)
    
    return {
        'probabilities': probabilities,
        'sentiment_score': sentiment,
        'market_count': len(markets),
        'last_updated': datetime.now()
    }
```

### Sentiment Calculation

```python
def calculate_sentiment(probabilities):
    """
    Calculate market sentiment from probabilities
    Returns: -100 to 100 score
    """
    bullish_score = 0
    bearish_score = 0
    
    for question, probability in probabilities.items():
        if "reach" in question and probability > 50:
            bullish_score += (probability - 50)
        elif "fall" in question and probability > 50:
            bearish_score += (probability - 50)
    
    # Normalize to -100 to 100
    total = bullish_score + bearish_score
    if total > 0:
        return min(100, (bullish_score / total) * 100)
    else:
        return max(-100, -(bearish_score / total) * 100)
```

## üìà Data Usage in Decision System

### Feature Integration

Polymarket data adds 4 new features to our 26-dimensional vector:

1. **polymarket_score** (-100 to 100)
   - Overall sentiment score
   - Positive = bullish, Negative = bearish

2. **polymarket_confidence** (0 to 100)
   - Based on trading volume and liquidity
   - Higher = more reliable

3. **bullish_markets** (count)
   - Number of markets with >50% bullish probability

4. **bearish_markets** (count)
   - Number of markets with >50% bearish probability

### Weight in Decision Engine

```python
# In decision_engine.py
weights = {
    'news': 0.25,          # News signals
    'price': 0.25,         # Price signals
    'sentiment': 0.20,     # Market sentiment
    'ai': 0.20,           # AI predictions
    'polymarket': 0.10     # Polymarket data ‚≠ê New
}
```

## üîç Quality Control

### Data Validation

```python
def validate_polymarket_data(data):
    """
    Validate Polymarket data quality
    """
    checks = {
        'has_markets': len(data['probabilities']) > 0,
        'recent_update': (datetime.now() - data['last_updated']).seconds < 3600,
        'volume_adequate': data['total_volume'] > 1000,
        'price_reasonable': all(0 <= p <= 100 for p in data['probabilities'].values())
    }
    
    return all(checks.values()), checks
```

### Fallback Strategy

If Polymarket data is unavailable:
1. Use traditional sentiment indicators
2. Increase weight of other sentiment sources
3. Log warning for manual review

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
# In main trading system
polymarket_data = fetch_polymarket_data()

    polymarket_data['confidence'],
    polymarket_data['bullish_markets'],
    polymarket_data['bearish_markets']
])
```

### Advanced Analysis

```python
def analyze_polymarket_trends():
    """
    Analyze Polymarket trend changes
    """
    historical_data = get_historical_polymarket()
    current_data = fetch_polymarket_data()
    
    # Calculate trend
    sentiment_change = current_data['sentiment_score'] - historical_data[-1]['sentiment_score']
    
    # Identify momentum
    if abs(sentiment_change) > 10:
        return "Strong momentum", sentiment_change
    elif abs(sentiment_change) > 5:
        return "Moderate momentum", sentiment_change
    else:
        return "Stable", sentiment_change
